        <!-- why do we need noop/noref? security (prevents phishing, tabnabbing. noref -> 
            not let opened link know your webpage links to it) note: what about affliates? -->

    <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="Picture of Charles the dog" height="300" width="250">
    <!-- 'alt' with every img is best practice -->
    <!-- it improves accessibility (for ex. screen readers) and it will be used if the image cannot be loaded -->
    <!-- always specifying size attributes for images is good practice -->
